        "about-part1": "My name is Jan, and I’m currently a second-year student of Information Technology at the Faculty of Education, Charles University. I’ve been interested in computers and technology since I was a kid — I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, what can be changed or improved, and why things look the way they do. 💻",
        "about-part2": "Gaming 🎮 has been a big part of my life from early on. For me, games are more than just entertainment — they’re a way to relax, unwind, and escape from reality for a while. Thanks to gaming, I’ve learned a lot of English 🇬🇧, and with games like Path of Exile, I really enjoy the strategy and thinking behind them. Sometimes, there’s just nothing better than turning everything off, opening a game, and getting lost in another world. 😄",
        "about-part3": "Since elementary school, I’ve been playing tennis 🎾 — my parents and grandparents guided me toward competitive play, so I trained seriously and gradually went through all the categories from young players up to adults. For a while, I even played for two towns on weekends – Zruč nad Sázavou (youth) and Ledeč nad Sázavou (adults). In high school, I was probably in the best shape of my life — my friend and I trained five to seven times a week.",
        "about-part4": "After graduation, I went to a Higher Vocational School focused on Business Economics and Management. I originally wanted to study IT, but I didn’t get in at the time, so I chose this path instead — and it turned out to be a valuable experience. During my internship, I worked with CZECH.UP z.s., an organization focused on gamified education, where we created educational online courses on topics like cybersecurity and financial literacy.",
        "about-part5": "In my internship evaluation, it was noted that I was considered a co-author of several projects, and I also earned a certificate as Lead Methodologist of the CZECH.UP JukeBox Platform for Gamified Learning. During this time, I led a team of students and friends in a project about financial literacy in cooperation with ČPP, and I also took part in international collaboration where CZECH.UP (CZ) worked together with partners from Slovakia 🇸🇰, Italy 🇮🇹, and Spain 🇪🇸. This experience taught me communication, leadership, and how to work effectively online. 🌍",
        "about-part6": "After successfully completing my studies, I passed my final exams in Economics, Accounting, Management, Costing, and English, and earned the DiS. title (Certified Specialist) — with honors! 🎓 Of course, my friends and I — the same group who studied together for three years — had to celebrate properly 🍻, and even though we don’t see each other as often now, we still keep in touch.",
        "about-part7": "Shortly after returning from a family vacation, I received an email that completely changed my plans — I was accepted to Charles University to study Information Technology with a focus on education, a field I had wanted to pursue for a long time. And it was there that I discovered what truly excites me — web development. 🖥️",
        "about-part8": "In my first year, I enrolled in an optional course called Web Development, where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and built my first website — Custom Project Company, which you can find in the Projects & News section. That’s where it all began.",
        "about-part9": "Now, in my second year, I’m taking the course again — but this time as a mandatory subject with a broader scope. Since all of us have already built websites before, we go through HTML and CSS faster, so we can spend more time on JavaScript, databases, and MySQL.",
        "about-part10": "I really enjoy working with websites — from designing layouts and tuning colors to writing the code itself. I like when everything fits together naturally and the result looks clean and balanced. ✨ I always meet deadlines, I’m reliable, and communication with me is easy — I usually reply within a few minutes. 😄",
        "about-part11": "In my free time, I love to play games 🎮 — gaming has been a big part of my life for years and still is. Sometimes I try out new things in HTML/CSS or do a bit of coding, but when I’m not creating, I like to watch Outdoor Boys, grab a beer 🍺, and just relax. I’m also learning Python and experimenting with the Pygame library, where I’m slowly learning to make simple games — it’s still more of an experiment, but I really enjoy it. 🐍",
        "about-part12": "I’m truly grateful for the people around me ❤️ — for my mom, who always supports me and does everything she can to make sure I’m happy 🌷, for my grandparents, who help and give me valuable advice 👵👴, and for my girlfriend, who supports me, believes in me, and stands by me even when I doubt myself. 💞",

        "PP-tech-creation3": "I started by sketching design ideas on paper, planning the layout and writing content for each section. Then I carefully built the website step by step — tag by tag — constantly revising, improving and fixing issues as I discovered them.",
        "PPlearned1": "Building my personal portfolio taught me a wide range of new web development skills.

O počítače a technologie se zajímám už od dětství — vždy mě fascinovalo, jak věci fungují, co se dá změnit nebo vylepšit a proč věci vypadají tak, jak vypadají. 💻",
        "about-part2": "Hraní her 🎮 je velkou součástí mého života už od malička. Pro mě nejsou hry jen zábava — je to způsob, jak si odpočinout, vypnout a na chvíli uniknout od reality. Díky hraní jsem se toho hodně naučil anglicky 🇬🇧 a u her jako Path of Exile si opravdu užívám strategii a promyšlené rozhodování. Někdy není nic lepšího než všechno vypnout, zapnout hru a na chvíli se ztratit v jiném světě. 😄",
        "about-part3": "Od základní školy jsem hrál tenis 🎾 — moji rodiče a prarodiče mě vedli k soutěžnímu sportu, takže jsem trénoval naplno a postupně prošel všemi kategoriemi od mládeže až po dospělé. Chvíli jsem dokonce hrával o víkendech za dvě města — Zruč nad Sázavou (dorostenci) a Ledeč nad Sázavou (dospělí). Na střední škole jsem byl asi v nejlepší formě — s kamarádem jsme trénovali pět až sedmkrát týdně.",
        "about-part4": "Po maturitě jsem nastoupil na Vyšší odbornou školu zaměřenou na Ekonomiku a management. Původně jsem chtěl studovat IT, ale tehdy mi to nevyšlo, tak jsem zvolil tuhle cestu — a nakonec to byla cenná zkušenost. Během praxe jsem pracoval s organizací CZECH.UP z.s., kde jsme tvořili online vzdělávací kurzy na témata jako kyberbezpečnost a finanční gramotnost.",
        "about-part5": "V hodnocení praxe bylo uvedeno, že jsem byl považován za spoluautora několika projektů, a také jsem získal certifikát Hlavního metodika platformy CZECH.UP JukeBox pro gamifikované vzdělávání. V té době jsem vedl tým studentů a kamarádů na projektu o finanční gramotnosti ve spolupráci s ČPP (Česká podnikatelská pojišťovna), a také jsem se zapojil do mezinárodní spolupráce, kde CZECH.UP (CZ) pracoval s partnery ze Slovenska 🇸🇰, Itálie 🇮🇹 a Španělska 🇪🇸. Tahle zkušenost mě naučila komunikaci, vedení lidí a efektivní online spolupráci. 🌍",
        "about-part6": "Po úspěšném dokončení studia jsem úspěšně složil závěrečné zkoušky z ekonomiky, účetnictví, managementu, kalkulací a angličtiny a získal titul DiS.

        "about-part7": "Krátce po návratu z rodinné dovolené jsem dostal e-mail, který mi úplně změnil plány — byl jsem přijat na Univerzitu Karlovu na obor Informační technologie se zaměřením na vzdělávání, obor, který jsem si přál studovat už dlouho. A právě tam jsem objevil, co mě opravdu baví — vývoj webu. 🖥️",
        "about-part8": "V prvním ročníku jsem si zapsal volitelný předmět Tvorba webových stránek, kde jsem se naučil základy HTML a CSS a vytvořil svůj úplně první web — Custom Project Company, který najdeš v sekci Projekty & Novinky. A tam to všechno začalo.",
        "about-part9": "Teď, ve druhém ročníku, je ten předmět povinný a má širší rozsah. Všichni už máme zkušenosti s weby, takže HTML a CSS projíždíme rychleji a můžeme se více věnovat JavaScriptu, databázím a MySQL.",
        "about-part10": "Práce na webech mě opravdu baví — od navrhování designu a ladění barev až po samotné psaní kódu. ✨ Mám rád, když spolu všechno přirozeně ladí a výsledek působí čistě a vyváženě. Dodržuji termíny, jsem spolehlivý a dobře komunikuji — většinou odpovídám během pár minut. 😄",
        "about-part11": "Ve volném čase rád hraju hry 🎮 — jsou velkou součástí mého života už spoustu let. Občas zkouším nové věci v HTML/CSS nebo trochu programuju, a když netvořím, rád se dívám na Outdoor Boys, zajdu s přáteli na jedno 🍺 a prostě relaxuju.

        "CPC-tech-creation3": "Také jsem využíval základní online zdroje jako W3Schools, Icons8 a nástroje pro výběr barevných palet, přičemž jsem občas využil i pomoc umělé inteligence při rozhodování o kódu a designu.",

        "PP-tech-creation2": "Původní myšlenkou bylo vytvořit jednoduché portfolio použitelné na platformách jako GitHub nebo portály pro freelancery. Koncept se ale rychle rozšířil do osobní webové stránky, kde mohu prezentovat sebe, své projekty a budoucí práci na jednom místě.",
        "PP-tech-creation3": "Začal jsem kreslením návrhů na papír, plánováním rozložení a psaním obsahu pro jednotlivé sekce. Poté jsem web postupně stavěl krok za krokem — tag po tagu — s neustálým vylepšováním, opravováním a dolaďováním detailů.",
        "PPlearned1": "Tvorba mého osobního portfolia mě naučila širokou škálu nových frontendových technik. Pracoval jsem například s CSS Gridem pro strukturu rozložení, aspect-ratio pro správné měřítko obrázků a vylepšenou sémantiku HTML pro přehlednější a přístupnější strukturu stránky.",
        "PPlearned2": "Byl to můj první plně samostatný projekt — bez daných pravidel nebo návrhů. Naučil mě, jak plánovat, navrhnout a postavit web od základu, dělat rozhodnutí samostatně a průběžně zlepšovat výslednou podobu.",
