        "about-part1": "My name is Jan, and I’m currently a second-year student of Information Technology at the Faculty of Education, Charles University. I’ve been interested in computers and technology since I was a kid — I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, what can be changed or improved, and why things look the way they do. 💻",
        "about-part2": "Gaming 🎮 has been a big part of my life from early on. For me, games are more than just entertainment — they’re a way to relax, unwind, and escape from reality for a while. Thanks to gaming, I’ve learned a lot of English 🇬🇧, and with games like Path of Exile, I really enjoy the strategy and thinking behind them. Sometimes, there’s just nothing better than turning everything off, opening a game, and getting lost in another world. 😄",
        "about-part3": "Since elementary school, I’ve been playing tennis 🎾 — my parents and grandparents guided me toward competitive play, so I trained seriously and gradually went through all the categories from young players up to adults. For a while, I even played for two towns on weekends – Zruč nad Sázavou (youth) and Ledeč nad Sázavou (adults). In high school, I was probably in the best shape of my life — my friend and I trained five to seven times a week.",
        "about-part4": "After graduation, I went to a Higher Vocational School focused on Business Economics and Management. I originally wanted to study IT, but I didn’t get in at the time, so I chose this path instead — and it turned out to be a valuable experience. During my internship, I worked with CZECH.UP z.s., an organization focused on gamified education, where we created educational online courses on topics like cybersecurity and financial literacy.",
        "about-part5": "In my internship evaluation, it was noted that I was considered a co-author of several projects, and I also earned a certificate as Lead Methodologist of the CZECH.UP JukeBox Platform for Gamified Learning. During this time, I led a team of students and friends in a project about financial literacy in cooperation with ČPP, and I also took part in international collaboration where CZECH.UP (CZ) worked together with partners from Slovakia 🇸🇰, Italy 🇮🇹, and Spain 🇪🇸. This experience taught me communication, leadership, and how to work effectively online. 🌍",
        "about-part6": "After successfully completing my studies, I passed my final exams in Economics, Accounting, Management, Costing, and English, and earned the DiS. title (Certified Specialist) — with honors! 🎓 Of course, my friends and I — the same group who studied together for three years — had to celebrate properly 🍻, and even though we don’t see each other as often now, we still keep in touch.",
        "about-part7": "Shortly after returning from a family vacation, I received an email that completely changed my plans — I was accepted to Charles University to study Information Technology with a focus on education, a field I had wanted to pursue for a long time. And it was there that I discovered what truly excites me — web development. 🖥️",
        "about-part8": "In my first year, I enrolled in an optional course called Web Development, where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and built my first website — Custom Project Company, which you can find in the Projects & News section. That’s where it all began.",
        "about-part9": "Now, in my second year, I’m taking the course again — but this time as a mandatory subject with a broader scope. Since all of us have already built websites before, we go through HTML and CSS faster, so we can spend more time on JavaScript, databases, and MySQL.",
        "about-part10": "I really enjoy working with websites — from designing layouts and tuning colors to writing the code itself. I like when everything fits together naturally and the result looks clean and balanced. ✨ I always meet deadlines, I’m reliable, and communication with me is easy — I usually reply within a few minutes. 😄",
        "about-part11": "In my free time, I love to play games 🎮 — gaming has been a big part of my life for years and still is. Sometimes I try out new things in HTML/CSS or do a bit of coding, but when I’m not creating, I like to watch Outdoor Boys, grab a beer 🍺, and just relax. I’m also learning Python and experimenting with the Pygame library, where I’m slowly learning to make simple games — it’s still more of an experiment, but I really enjoy it. 🐍",
        "about-part12": "I’m truly grateful for the people around me ❤️ — for my mom, who always supports me and does everything she can to make sure I’m happy 🌷, for my grandparents, who help and give me valuable advice 👵👴, and for my girlfriend, who supports me, believes in me, and stands by me even when I doubt myself. 💞",
        "about-part13": "If you like my work, projects, or my story, feel free to reach out. Maybe we can create something together that perfectly fits your vision. 🤝",

        "category-AG": "Web Development / ARG Design",
        "AGdescription-part1": "Aetheron's Gate was created as a project for a Web Creation course. Instead of a standard static page, I built an interactive interface that serves as an entrance to the \"Sanctum of Knowledge\". The goal was to create a site that doesn't just grant access, but requires interaction, thereby immersing the visitor in the narrative.",
        "AGdescription-part2": "The core of the project is a trial system. The visitor must answer a series of questions – a combination of riddles and technical IT questions. Correct answers yield an access password, which subsequently unlocks the main section containing narrative logs. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for the addition of future chapters.",
        "AG-tech-creation1": "The project is built on HTML and CSS without external frameworks. The visuals utilize a specific color palette, the Orbitron font, and \"glitch\" effects to evoke the atmosphere of a sci-fi interface. The emphasis was on making the design feel like a consistent operating system rather than a standard webpage.",
        "AG-tech-creation2": "Although the site lacks a traditional backend, it behaves dynamically thanks to Vanilla JavaScript. This handles terminal inputs, validates passwords, and manages game logic. To save the player's progress (avoiding the need to re-solve puzzles), I implemented Local Storage functionality.",
        "AG-tech-creation3": "Development took place locally in VS Code. I had to resolve the correct file structure and master relative paths to ensure the site functioned identically on my drive and the school server. I configured SFTP synchronization for deployment, which significantly sped up the workflow compared to manual copying.",
        "AGlearned1": "Through this project, I significantly improved my ability to integrate HTML and JavaScript. I learned how to use JS to \"reach\" into the page, select specific elements by ID or class, read their values, and dynamically alter content or styles based on user actions.",
        "AGlearned2": "It was a valuable lesson in transforming an abstract idea into a functional product. I realized that even seemingly simple tasks, like password verification, require careful handling of conditions in the code.

        "about-part1": "Jmenuji se Honza a momentálně studuji druhý ročník oboru Informační technologie na Pedagogické fakultě Univerzity Karlovy. O počítače a technologie se zajímám už od dětství — vždy mě fascinovalo, jak věci fungují, co se dá změnit nebo vylepšit a proč věci vypadají tak, jak vypadají. 💻",
        "about-part2": "Hraní her 🎮 je velkou součástí mého života už od malička. Pro mě nejsou hry jen zábava — je to způsob, jak si odpočinout, vypnout a na chvíli uniknout od reality. Díky hraní jsem se toho hodně naučil anglicky 🇬🇧 a u her jako Path of Exile si opravdu užívám strategii a promyšlené rozhodování. Někdy není nic lepšího než všechno vypnout, zapnout hru a na chvíli se ztratit v jiném světě. 😄",
        "about-part3": "Od základní školy jsem hrál tenis 🎾 — moji rodiče a prarodiče mě vedli k soutěžnímu sportu, takže jsem trénoval naplno a postupně prošel všemi kategoriemi od mládeže až po dospělé. Chvíli jsem dokonce hrával o víkendech za dvě města — Zruč nad Sázavou (dorostenci) a Ledeč nad Sázavou (dospělí). Na střední škole jsem byl asi v nejlepší formě — s kamarádem jsme trénovali pět až sedmkrát týdně.",
        "about-part4": "Po maturitě jsem nastoupil na Vyšší odbornou školu zaměřenou na Ekonomiku a management. Původně jsem chtěl studovat IT, ale tehdy mi to nevyšlo, tak jsem zvolil tuhle cestu — a nakonec to byla cenná zkušenost. Během praxe jsem pracoval s organizací CZECH.UP z.s., kde jsme tvořili online vzdělávací kurzy na témata jako kyberbezpečnost a finanční gramotnost.",
        "about-part5": "V hodnocení praxe bylo uvedeno, že jsem byl považován za spoluautora několika projektů, a také jsem získal certifikát Hlavního metodika platformy CZECH.UP JukeBox pro gamifikované vzdělávání. V té době jsem vedl tým studentů a kamarádů na projektu o finanční gramotnosti ve spolupráci s ČPP (Česká podnikatelská pojišťovna), a také jsem se zapojil do mezinárodní spolupráce, kde CZECH.UP (CZ) pracoval s partnery ze Slovenska 🇸🇰, Itálie 🇮🇹 a Španělska 🇪🇸. Tahle zkušenost mě naučila komunikaci, vedení lidí a efektivní online spolupráci. 🌍",
        "about-part6": "Po úspěšném dokončení studia jsem úspěšně složil závěrečné zkoušky z ekonomiky, účetnictví, managementu, kalkulací a angličtiny a získal titul DiS. (Diplomovaný specialista) — na červený diplom! 🎓 A samozřejmě jsme to s kamarády pořádně oslavili 🍻 — i když už se nevídáme tak často, pořád jsme v kontaktu.",
        "about-part7": "Krátce po návratu z rodinné dovolené jsem dostal e-mail, který mi úplně změnil plány — byl jsem přijat na Univerzitu Karlovu na obor Informační technologie se zaměřením na vzdělávání, obor, který jsem si přál studovat už dlouho. A právě tam jsem objevil, co mě opravdu baví — vývoj webu. 🖥️",
        "about-part8": "V prvním ročníku jsem si zapsal volitelný předmět Tvorba webových stránek, kde jsem se naučil základy HTML a CSS a vytvořil svůj úplně první web — Custom Project Company, který najdeš v sekci Projekty & Novinky. A tam to všechno začalo.",
        "about-part9": "Teď, ve druhém ročníku, je ten předmět povinný a má širší rozsah. Všichni už máme zkušenosti s weby, takže HTML a CSS projíždíme rychleji a můžeme se více věnovat JavaScriptu, databázím a MySQL.",
        "about-part10": "Práce na webech mě opravdu baví — od navrhování designu a ladění barev až po samotné psaní kódu. ✨ Mám rád, když spolu všechno přirozeně ladí a výsledek působí čistě a vyváženě. Dodržuji termíny, jsem spolehlivý a dobře komunikuji — většinou odpovídám během pár minut. 😄",
        "about-part11": "Ve volném čase rád hraju hry 🎮 — jsou velkou součástí mého života už spoustu let. Občas zkouším nové věci v HTML/CSS nebo trochu programuju, a když netvořím, rád se dívám na Outdoor Boys, zajdu s přáteli na jedno 🍺 a prostě relaxuju. Taky se učím Python a experimentuju s knihovnou Pygame — zatím spíš zábavné pokusy, ale strašně mě to baví. 🐍",
        "about-part12": "Jsem moc vděčný lidem kolem sebe ❤️ — mamce, která mě vždy podporuje a dělá první poslední pro to, abychom byli s bráchou šťastný 🌷, prarodičům, kteří mi pomáhají a radí 👵👴, a mojí přítelkyni, která mi věří, podporuje mě a stojí při mně i v momentech, kdy sám o sobě pochybuji. 💞",
