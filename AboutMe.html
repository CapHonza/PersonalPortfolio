            <p data-lang-key="about-part" data-lang-html> Hi there! 👋 </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part1" data-lang-html>
                My name is Jan, and I’m currently a second-year student of Information Technology at the Faculty of Education, Charles University.
                I’ve been interested in computers and technology since I was a kid — I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, 
                what can be changed or improved, and why things look the way they do. 💻
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part2" data-lang-html>
                Gaming 🎮 has been a big part of my life from early on. For me, games are more than just entertainment — they’re a way to relax, unwind, 
                and escape from reality for a while. Thanks to gaming, I’ve learned a lot of English 🇬🇧, and with games like Path of Exile, 
                I really enjoy the strategy and thinking behind them. Sometimes, there’s just nothing better than turning everything off, opening a game, 
                and getting lost in another world. 😄
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part3" data-lang-html>
                Since elementary school, I’ve been playing tennis 🎾 — my parents and grandparents guided me toward competitive play, 
                so I trained seriously and gradually went through all the categories from young players up to adults. For a while, I even played for two towns 
                on weekends – Zruč nad Sázavou (youth) and Ledeč nad Sázavou (adults). In high school, I was probably in the best shape of my life — 
                my friend and I trained five to seven times a week.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part4" data-lang-html>
                After graduation, I went to a Higher Vocational School focused on Business Economics and Management. I originally wanted to study IT, 
                but I didn’t get in at the time, so I chose this path instead — and it turned out to be a valuable experience. 
                During my internship, I worked with CZECH.UP z.s., an organization focused on gamified education, where we created educational online 
                courses on topics like cybersecurity and financial literacy.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part5" data-lang-html>
                In my internship evaluation, it was noted that I was considered a co-author of several projects, and I also earned a certificate as 
                Lead Methodologist of the CZECH.UP JukeBox Platform for Gamified Learning. During this time, I led a team of students and friends in a 
                project about financial literacy in cooperation with ČPP, and I also took part in international collaboration where CZECH.UP (CZ) 
                worked together with partners from Slovakia 🇸🇰, Italy 🇮🇹, and Spain 🇪🇸. This experience taught me communication, leadership, 
                and how to work effectively online. 🌍
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part6" data-lang-html>
                After successfully completing my studies, I passed my final exams in Economics, Accounting, Management, Costing, and English, and earned 
                the DiS. title (Certified Specialist) — with honors! 🎓 Of course, my friends and I — the same group who studied together for three years — 
                had to celebrate properly 🍻, and even though we don’t see each other as often now, we still keep in touch.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part7" data-lang-html>
                Shortly after returning from a family vacation, I received an email that completely changed my plans — I was accepted to Charles University to 
                study Information Technology with a focus on education, a field I had wanted to pursue for a long time. And it was there that I discovered 
                what truly excites me — web development. 🖥️
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part8" data-lang-html>
                In my first year, I enrolled in an optional course called Web Development, where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and built my first website — 
                Custom Project Company, which you can find in the Projects & News section. That’s where it all began.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part9" data-lang-html>
                Now, in my second year, I’m taking the course again — but this time as a mandatory subject with a broader scope. Since all of us have already 
                built websites before, we go through HTML and CSS faster, so we can spend more time on JavaScript, databases, and MySQL.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part10" data-lang-html>
                I really enjoy working with websites — from designing layouts and tuning colors to writing the code itself. I like when everything fits 
                together naturally and the result looks clean and balanced. ✨ I always meet deadlines, I’m reliable, and communication with me is easy — 
                I usually reply within a few minutes. 😄
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part11" data-lang-html>
                In my free time, I love to play games 🎮 — gaming has been a big part of my life for years and still is. Sometimes I try out new things in 
                HTML/CSS or do a bit of coding, but when I’m not creating, I like to watch Outdoor Boys, grab a beer 🍺, and just relax.
                I’m also learning Python and experimenting with the Pygame library, where I’m slowly learning to make simple games — 
                it’s still more of an experiment, but I really enjoy it. 🐍
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part12" data-lang-html>
                I’m truly grateful for the people around me ❤️ — for my mom, who always supports me and does everything she can to make sure I’m happy 🌷, 
                for my grandparents, who help and give me valuable advice 👵👴, and for my girlfriend, who supports me, believes in me, and stands by me even when I doubt myself. 💞 
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="about-part13" data-lang-html>
